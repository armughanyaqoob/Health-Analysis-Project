# Health Analysis Project

## Overview

The Health Analysis Project utilizes public health data from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) related to obesity, inactivity, and diabetes. The dataset, "cdc-diabetes-2018.xlsx," is analyzed using Python scripts contained in "health_analysis.py."

The project aims to explore relationships between obesity, inactivity, and diabetes across different states, providing visualizations and statistical insights.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels

## Project Structure

- **cdc-diabetes-2018.xlsx:** Excel file containing the health-related dataset.
- **health_analysis.py:** Python script for data analysis and visualization.

## Instructions

```bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-analysis-project.git

# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Analysis Script
python health_analysis.py
```
# RESULTS

The script produces visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation analyses for obesity, inactivity, and diabetes across different states. Key results include:

Identification of states with the highest and lowest health indicators.
Linear regression analyses for understanding relationships between variables.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and clustering for exploring patterns in the data.
